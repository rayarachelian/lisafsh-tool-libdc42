# lisafsh-tool-libdc42
Lisa File System Tools and libdc42

This is a part of LisaEm 1.3.0, but since 1.3.0 isn't ready yet, and there's interest in this code, I'm, releasing it separately.

This code is released under the terms of the LGPL or GPL.

To build this code: ./build.sh clean build
To install: ./build.sh clean build install

While this "requires" wx-widgets, it doesn't really, that's more of a LisaEm requirement.
