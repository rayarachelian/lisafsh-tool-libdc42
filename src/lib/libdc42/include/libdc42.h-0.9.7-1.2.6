* Requirements:                                                                        *

* This code currently requires OS support for POSIX memory mapping.  i.e. mmap.  Your  *
* OS must support this, for these functions to work. Future versions might remove this *
* requirement depending on requested needs of this library's users.                    *
*                                                                                      *
* A side effect of this is that your application may potentially use more memory if    *
* you attempt to use very large disk images (i.e. it might use 20MB of real RAM if your*
* application accesses the entire space of a 20MB disk image.                          *
*                                                                                      *
* ************************************************************************************ *
*                                                                                      *
* The word image refers to a disk image, not a picture or graphic.  In this context,   *
* disk image is a single file containing all of the sectors and associated metadata for*
* a storage medium - i.e. a floppy disk.                                               *
*                                                                                      *
*                                                                                      *
* These routines are file system agnostic, that is, they don't care what file system   *
* the disk images hold.  They allow you to use the DC42 format as a container for disk *
* images.  This would make it useful for various emulators of Apple hardware.          *
*                                                                                      *
* Note that this library can be used to create hard drive images as well, but that they*
* are incompatible with the real Disk Copy program.                                    *
*                                                                                      *
* DC42 images are ignorant of the physical layout of their media.  That is they only   *
* know the number of sectors within the container, not the number of sides, tracks, or *
* sectors per track of a specific storage device/media.  You may need to translate     *
* from head/track/sector to absolute sector depending on your (emulator's) needs.      *
*                                                                                      *
* These routines were created from publically released information about Apple's Disk  *
* Copy and DART programs from code and Apple IIgs tech notes found on the web along    *
* with some experimentation using disk images.  Experimental support for coverting     *
* DART disk images to DC42 images is included, but there is not support for LZH        *
* compressed DART images (i.e. Fast compression is supported, Best is not.)            *
*                                                                                      *

* Note that modern versions of Apple's Disk Copy program do not support tags, which    *
* the Lisa computer requires for proper operation.  It is unwise to convert DART disk  *
* images using modern versions of Disk Copy (i.e. 6.x) as this strips off all tags.    *
*                                                                                      *
* It's unswise to mount DiskCopy 4.2 images on a modern Mac, even if the image is Mac  *
* formatted without having a backup.  Note that some older Mac formats cannot be read  *
* by modern Mac's.  i.e if they're MFS instead of HFS. (This is circa Mac System 5 and *
* earlier.  MFS formatted disks are read-only accessible from under System 7, but not  *
* sure if OS X or System 9 can access them.)                                           *
*                                                                                      *
* If you wish to convert DART disk images to Disk Copy 4.2 images, you will need an    *
* old Macintosh with a GCR capable floppy drive, copies of both DART and Disk Copy 4.2.*
* You will have to restore the DART image to a real floppy using DART, then creating a *
* new image using the real Disk Copy 4.2 program.                                      *
*                                                                                      *
* You may also use the routine in this library to convert from DART to DiskCopy42      *
* format, but this only works for DART images compressed using RLE, and is experimental*
* at this time.  The safest way to convert DART images is by using real Mac hardware   *
* and the real DART and Disk Copy 4.2 applications.                                    *
*                                                                                      *
* These routines are experimental, so always excercise caution and make proper backups *
* of your disk images before allowing them to access your disk images.                 *
*                                                                                      *

* Usage of these routines:                                                             *

* Allocate a DC42ImageType structure for each disk image you wish to have open.  Pass a   *
* pointer to this structure to the function calls that require it.                     *
*                                                                                      *
* Some of the routines do not access an opened DC42ImageType structure, and may only be   *
* used with the image file in the closed state.  No checking is done, so if you ignore *
* this warning, you'll find the image may be corrupted.                                *
*                                                                                      *
* These are: dc42_create, dart_to_dc42 and dc42_add_tags                               *
*                                                                                      *

* open - opens a disk image (and uses mmap to map in memory.)                          *
* close - closes a disk image and option saves changes made to it and the new checksums*
*         back to the disk image.                                                      *
*                                                                                      *
* read sector - read a sector                                                          *
* read tag    - read the tag data for a specific sector                                *
* write sector - write the sector (may be discarded depending on open mode)            *
* write tag    - write tag data to a sector (may be discarded depending on open mode)  *
*                                                                                      *

Note that these routines are not guaranteed to be thread-safe.  Use mutext locks around calls to them, or limit
access to a specific disk image access to a single thread.

You can open as many disk images as you'd like since each one will have their own DC42ImageType struct.

If you choose not to use the memory mapped, or RAM modes, the routines will allocate a buffer large enough for a single
sector and its tags.  So you must handle the data immediately.

If you use either the memory mapped or RAM modes, it is fairly safe, but not recommended to reuse the pointers to the
data and pass them around.  This is not advised, however.

                                                                                   // wrapper.  Note that the previously opened file
                                                                                   // descriptor should match the permissions you use.
                                                                                   // i.e. if you use 'w', the fd must have been opened
                                                                                   // in read/write mode, not read only!


F: pointer to DC42ImageType - you must allocate this yourself before calling the open function.  You'll need to pass the pointer
                      to this structure to most of these calls.

filename: path/filename to the disk image.

fd: file descriptor.  For the _by_handle version of the function.  Allows you to open a disk image that's embedded inside another
                      file.  For example, one that is inside a MacBinaryII wrapper.  Note that you must call lseek to the position
                      of the start of the DC42 image before calling dc42_open_by_handle.  You must use the _by_handle version of the
                      close function, and then close the file descriptor yourself.  Of course, you should never close the file
                      descriptor before calling the close function.

                      If the file containing the DC42 image has checksums or CRC's it is your responsability to recalculate and
                      update those after closing the DC42 image.

                      When you issue the open call to get the file descript, you must ensure that it matches the permissions you
                      ask for in the options to dc42_open_by_handle.   i.e. if you use 'w', the fd must have been opened in r/w
                      mode, not read only!

start: for the open_by_handle call.  This is the offset into the file to the DC42 image.  If 0, will use the current position

options: string containing any of the following (last option takes precedence)

 r=read only        - attempts to write return an error.
 w=read/write       - normal read/write access
 p=private writes   - writes not written back to disk, they are kept in RAM to fool emulators however, will be lost
                      when the image is closed. If you change your mind and want to keep changes, you should create a identically
                      sized image, and copy all the data to it, then delete the original, and rename the new one to have the same
                      file name.)

                      This option will only work if you choose memory mapped I/O or RAM. i.e. use either 'b' or 'a' to guarantee
                      that it will work.  If you use 'm' and your OS doesn't have mmap/mmsync/mmunmap functions, it will fail.
                      If you use 'n', it will always fail.

 m=memory mapped    - use memory mapped I/O if available to your OS, otherwise, use just plain disk I/O (same as 'n').
 n=never use memory - never use mmapped I/O, nor RAM.  Suitable for systems that are low on memory.
 a=always in RAM.   - disk image will always remain in memory, we'll manage it ourselves, even if we have mmapped I/O available.
 b=best choice      - use the best choice available for speed.   if we have mmapped I/O in the OS, use that, otherwise load the
                      the whole image in RAM.


 If you want to simulate the 'p' option on a low memory system, you should first copy the disk image to a temporary file, then
 open the temporary file with "wn".  After you close the temporary file, delete it.




int dc42_close_image(DC42ImageType *F);

  or

int dc42_close_image_by_handle(DC42ImageType *F)



These functions close the disk image and if it was requested on the call, will write the data back to the disk, updating the
checksums.

Danger! You must call the appropriate function.  If you used dc42_open_by_handle, you must call dc42_close_image_by_handle.





int dc42_create(char *filename, char *volname, uint32 datasize, uint32 tagsize)    // create a blank new disk image
                                                                                   // sizes are in bytes.  pass *1024 for KB.
                                                                                   // does not open the image, only creates it, so
                                                                                   // call open if you want to open it after creating it.

uint8 *dc42_read_sector_tags(DC42ImageType *F, uint32 sectornumber);               // read a sector's tag data
uint8 *dc42_read_sector_data(DC42ImageType *F, uint32 sectornumber);               // read a sector's data
int dc42_write_sector_tags(DC42ImageType *F, uint32 sectornumber, uint8 *tagdata); // write tag data to a sector
int dc42_write_sector_data(DC42ImageType *F, uint32 sectornumber, uint8 *data);    // write sector data to a sector

   read calls return a pointer to the sector's data or tag.  Note that if you're not using mmapped I/O or RAM, the pointer to
   the data will be re-used between calls, and therefore old pointers from previous reads cannot be considered to be valid!

   write will write the data you provide to the image.  Write returns any error numbers.

   You can access F->errormsg and F->retval to get the results of the requested operation.


These next functions will NOT actually open a disk image, but will open a file handle to them.

 -4 no tag data in this image
 -5 file descriptor is negative (file not open?)
 -6 could not open file for reading
